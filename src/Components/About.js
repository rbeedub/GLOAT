            <p>We are dedicated to pairing up Jordans and Jordan lovers.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>The history of Nike Jordans began in 1984, when Michael Jordan, who was then a rookie player for the Chicago Bulls, signed a shoe contract with Nike. The first Air Jordan shoes, now known as Air Jordans, were released in 1985. 
                The shoes were designed by Peter Moore and were inspired by the "Black Panther" car that Michael Jordan had seen in the showroom. The original Air Jordans were banned by the NBA for not meeting the league's uniform color requirements, but that only helped to make the shoes more popular. 
                Jordan wore the shoes anyway and was fined $5,000 for each game he wore them, but Nike paid the fines.Over the next several years, Nike released new versions of the Air Jordans, each with a new design and new features. The brand also expanded to include clothing and accessories.
                As Jordan's fame grew, so did the popularity of the Air Jordans. Today, the Air Jordans are considered a cultural icon, and they continue to be one of the most popular and successful shoe lines in history. In 2020, the Air Jordans celebrated its 35th anniversary. 
                Many limited edition models were release during that time and still now. Air Jordan's line is still considered one of the most sought-after sneakers on the market and continues to be a cultural symbol of style and success.</p>
            <p>Sneakerheads are individuals who are passionate about collecting, buying, selling, and trading sneakers, particularly limited edition or rare models. They often have extensive knowledge about different sneaker brands and models, and may be actively involved in online communities or forums dedicated to the hobby. </p>
